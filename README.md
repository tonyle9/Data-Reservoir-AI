# Data-Reservoir-AI
Work In Progress.
An artificial intelligence systems based on a data reservoir acted upon by compute units.  The compute units can be a single neural network layer, an associative memory or any other type of compute.  The reservoir is broken into 3 parts [input][writable][general].
Information is gathered by random projection from the entire reservoir via a selection process and sent to a compute unit.  The output of the compute unit can be either written to a specific writable part or added to the general part via a selection process.  The system is to learn by evolution, for example you create a parent and mutated child reservoir and swap their roles depending on who is better.
It's not finished yet but I want to put it in the public domain in some form at an early stage.
